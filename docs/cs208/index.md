## Participation

This is an online asynchronous class, thus all of our interactions and
participation will be done through canvas using discussion boards and
video posts.

## Projects

There are several individual projects this semester.

- [Project 1](https://github.com/shanep/cs208-p1-starter) - This project is a
  warmup project and is intended to introduce you to the tools and techniques
  that we will be using for the rest of the semester.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/shanep/cs208-p2-starter) - This project will
  evaluate your knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- [Project 3](https://github.com/shanep/cs208-p3-starter) - This project will
  evaluate your knowledge of Javascript.

  introduces and evaluates full stack web development.
- [Project 5](https://github.com/shanep/cs208-p5-starter) - This project will be
  group based and allow you to practice not only your web development skills but
  also use git and GitHub in a team based environment. All grades are given
  **individually** so even though you will work in a group you will grade will
  not be impacted by any team members lack of effort or contributions.
